- **Login Simulation** – Basic login functionality (frontend only).  
- **Save Notes** – Notes persist locally during the session.

- **Responsive Design** – Works smoothly on desktop and mobile devices.

## Notes

The app currently does **not include dark mode** due to time and compatibility constraints. Dark mode can be added in the future using **Chakra UI’s theme system** or **next-themes**.

All features work fully in **light mode**.

## Future Enhancements

- Dark mode support  
- Persistent login using backend or local storage  
- Note categories or tags  
- Note editing/deletion confirmation  
- Export notes to PDF or other formats

This version:

- Is properly formatted in Markdown.  
- Has **all relevant project details**.  
- Mentions dark mode as an optional enhancement.  
- Is clean and professional for submission.  

If you want, I can also create a **slim “one-page” version** suitable for GitHub project showcase that’s **very concise and neat**.  

Do you want me to do that?
